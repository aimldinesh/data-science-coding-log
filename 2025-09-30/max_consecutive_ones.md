# âœ… Problem Statement  

You are given a **binary array** `nums` (containing only `0` and `1`).  
Return the **maximum number of consecutive 1's** in the array.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example  
```text
**Input**  
nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]

Output:3

Explanation:
The first two `1`s form a sequence of length 2.  
The next three `1`s form a sequence of length 3.  
Hence, the maximum consecutive ones = `3`.  
```
---

## ðŸš€ Approach
1. Initialize two variables:  
   - `count` â†’ to store the current streak of consecutive `1`s.  
   - `max_count` â†’ to store the maximum streak so far.  

2. Traverse the array:  
   - If the element is `1`, increase `count` and update `max_count`.  
   - If the element is `0`, reset `count` to `0`.  

3. Return `max_count` as the result.

## ðŸ’» Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0         # Current consecutive ones
        max_count = 0     # Maximum consecutive ones found

        for num in nums:
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
                max_count = max(max_count, count)  # Update max if current streak is larger
            else:
                count = 0  # Reset current streak on zero

        return max_count
```

## ðŸ’¡ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(n)
    - single pass through the array
- **Space**: O(1)
    - only constant extra space used
