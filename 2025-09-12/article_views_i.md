## ‚úÖ Problem Statement
Table: `Views`  

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| article_id  | int     |
| author_id   | int     |
| viewer_id   | int     |
| view_date   | date    |

- `(article_id, viewer_id, view_date)` is the primary key.  
- Each row of this table shows that a viewer viewed an article written by a certain author on a specific date.  

**Task:**  
Write an SQL query to find all the authors who **viewed at least one of their own articles**.  
Return the result table containing only `author_id`, sorted in **ascending order**.  

---

### üìù Approach  
- A self-view happens when `author_id = viewer_id`.  
- Use a `WHERE` condition to filter such rows.  
- Use `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicates.  
- Use alias `AS id` to match required output column name.  
- Finally, `ORDER BY id ASC`.  

---

### üíª Query  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY id ASC;
```

---

## üîç Explanation

- WHERE author_id = viewer_id ‚Üí selects rows where authors view their own articles.
- DISTINCT ‚Üí avoids duplicate author entries.
- AS id ‚Üí renames the output column to match requirements.
- ORDER BY id ASC ‚Üí sorts authors in ascending order.
