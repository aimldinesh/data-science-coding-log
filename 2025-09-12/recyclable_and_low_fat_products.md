## ‚úÖ Problem Statement
Table: `Products`  

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |

- `product_id` is the primary key for this table.  
- `low_fats` is an ENUM of type (`'Y'`, `'N'`) where `'Y'` means this product is low fat.  
- `recyclable` is an ENUM of type (`'Y'`, `'N'`) where `'Y'` means this product is recyclable.  

**Task:**  
Write an SQL query to find the IDs of products that are both **low fat** and **recyclable**.  
Return the result table in **any order**. 

---

## üöÄ Approach
- The table `Products` has information about each product with two binary attributes:  
  - `low_fats` (`'Y'`/`'N'`)  
  - `recyclable` (`'Y'`/`'N'`)  
- We need to find the `product_id` of products that are **both low fat and recyclable**.  
- Use a simple `WHERE` filter with conditions on both columns.

---

## üíª Query

```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y'
  AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

---

## üîç Explanation
- WHERE low_fats = 'Y' ‚Üí filters only low-fat products.
- AND recyclable = 'Y' ‚Üí keeps only those that are also recyclable.
- The SELECT product_id outputs the required IDs.
- ‚úÖ Simple filter query using multiple conditions in WHERE.
