## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
We are given a `Seat` table:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |

- `id` is the primary key and starts from 1, incrementing continuously.  
- Each row represents the student assigned to a seat.  

**Task:** Swap the seat `id` of every two consecutive students.  
- If the number of students is odd, the last student remains unchanged.  
- Return the table ordered by `id`.

---

## ðŸš€ Approach
1. We need to **swap students in pairs**:
   - Student at **odd id** should take the seat of the **next (id+1)**.
   - Student at **even id** should take the seat of the **previous (id-1)**.
   - If the last row is odd and has no partner â†’ keep as is.
2. Use a `CASE` expression to remap the `id` for each student:
   - If `id` is odd **and not the last row** â†’ new id = `id + 1`.
   - If `id` is even â†’ new id = `id - 1`.
   - If last student is odd â†’ keep same `id`.
3. Order results by `id` to preserve final sequence.

## ðŸ’» SQL Query

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id != (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat)
            THEN id + 1
        WHEN id % 2 = 0
            THEN id - 1
        ELSE id
    END AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;
```

---

## ðŸ”Ž Query Explanation

- id % 2 = 1 AND id != (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) â†’ For odd ids (except the last one if odd), assign them the next id.
- id % 2 = 0 â†’ For even ids, assign them the previous id.
- ELSE id â†’ Keeps the last student unchanged if total students count is odd.
- Final ORDER BY id ensures ascending order of seat IDs.
