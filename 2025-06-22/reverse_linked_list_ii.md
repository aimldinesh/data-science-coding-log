## âœ… Problem Statement
- Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right (1-indexed), reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the modified list.
### ðŸ“Œ Examples
```python
Input:
head = 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ 5  
left = 2, right = 4

Output:
1 â†’ 4 â†’ 3 â†’ 2 â†’ 5

## ðŸš€ Approach
ðŸ’¡ Intuition
- To reverse a part of the list, we need to:
    - Reach the node just before the reversal segment (leftPrev)
    - Reverse nodes between positions left and right
    - Reconnect the reversed sublist with the remaining list
- We use a dummy node to handle edge cases like reversing from the head of the list.

ðŸ‘£ Approach
- Create a dummy node pointing to the head of the list.
- Move a pointer leftPrev to the node just before position left, and cur to the left-th node.
- Reverse the sublist of length right - left + 1 starting from cur.
- Reconnect:
    - leftPrev.next should point to the new head of the reversed sublist.
    - The original left-th node (now tail) should point to the node after position right.
- Return dummy.next.

## ðŸ’» Code (Python)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Create a dummy node that points to head (helps handle edge cases)
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)

        # Step 1: Move `leftPrev` to the node before the `left`th node
        leftPrev, cur = dummy, head
        for _ in range(left - 1):
            leftPrev, cur = cur, cur.next

        # Step 2: Reverse nodes between left and right
        prev = None
        for _ in range(right - left + 1):
            tmpNext = cur.next       # Temporarily store the next node
            cur.next = prev          # Reverse the link
            prev, cur = cur, tmpNext # Move pointers ahead

        # Step 3: Reconnect the reversed sublist with the original list
        leftPrev.next.next = cur     # Connect the tail of reversed sublist to the node after `right`
        leftPrev.next = prev         # Connect the node before `left` to the new head of reversed sublist

        # Return the new head (may have changed)
        return dummy.next
```

## ðŸ’¡ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(n)
  -We traverse the list once.
- **Space**: O(1)
  - In-place reversal, no extra data structures used.
