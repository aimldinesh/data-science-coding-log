## âœ… Problem Statement
- You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version has some bugs.Your goal is to find the first bad version among n versions using the isBadVersion API.

---

## ðŸš€ My Approach
- We use Binary Search to reduce the search space.
- If mid is a bad version, we move the right pointer to mid.
- If mid is not bad, we move the left pointer to mid + 1.
- The loop stops when left == right, which is the first bad version

## ðŸ’» Code (Python)

```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 1, n  # Versions start from 1

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                right = mid  # First bad version could be at mid or before
            else:
                left = mid + 1  # Bad version must be after mid

        return left  # Left will point to the first bad version

```

## ðŸ’¡ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(log n), We use Binary Search, which repeatedly halves the search space, leading to logarithmic time complexity.
- **Space**: O(1), No extra space is used except for a few variables (left, right, mid), so it's constant space.
