## âœ… Problem Statement
Given an array of numbers `arr`, return `True` if the array can be rearranged to form an **arithmetic progression**. Otherwise, return `False`.
> An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between consecutive elements is constant.
---

## ðŸš€ Approach
- Sort the array.
- Compute the common difference using the first two elements.
- Iterate through the array and check if each consecutive difference equals the common difference.
- If all differences match, return True; otherwise, return False

## ðŸ’» Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def canMakeArithmeticProgression(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        # Sort the array to check consecutive differences
        arr.sort()

        # Calculate the common difference from the first two terms
        diff = arr[1] - arr[0]

        # Check the difference for all consecutive terms
        for i in range(2, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] != diff:
                return False  # Not an arithmetic progression

        return True  # All differences match
             
```

## ðŸ’¡ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(n log n), due to sorting
- **Space**: O(1), no extra space used
