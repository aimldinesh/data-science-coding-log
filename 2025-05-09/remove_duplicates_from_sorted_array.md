## âœ… Problem Statement
- Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.
- Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

---

## ðŸ§  Intuition
- Since the array is sorted, all duplicates will be adjacent.
- Use two pointers:
   - r scans through the array.
   - l keeps track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.

## ðŸš€ My Approach
- Start with l = 1, since the first element is always unique.
- For every element from index 1 to end:
   - If the current element is different from the previous one:
        - Assign it to position l.
        - Increment l.
- The value of l will be the count of unique elements.

## ðŸ’» Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize a pointer 'l' to track the position of the next unique element
        l = 1
        
        # Start iterating from the second element (index 1) since the first element is always unique
        for r in range(1, len(nums)):
            # If the current element is different from the previous one, it's a unique element
            if nums[r] != nums[r-1]:
                nums[l] = nums[r]  # Move the unique element to the 'l' position
                l += 1  # Increment 'l' to the next position for a unique element
        
        # Return 'l', which represents the length of the array with unique elements at the start
        return l       
        

```

## ðŸ’¡ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(n)
   - We iterate through the array once using a single loop.
   - Each element is visited at most once, so the runtime scales linearly with the size of nums.
- **Space**: O(1)
   - The algorithm uses only constant extra space:
      - Two pointers (l and r).
   - No additional data structures are used.
