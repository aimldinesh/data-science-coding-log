## âœ… Problem Statement
- Design a `TimeMap` class that supports the following two operations:

1. `set(key: str, value: str, timestamp: int)`: Stores the key with the given value and timestamp.
2. `get(key: str, timestamp: int)`: Returns a value such that `set` was called previously with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`, and returns the value associated with the largest such `timestamp_prev`. If there is no such value, return `""`.


---

## ðŸš€ My Approach
- Use a dictionary `keyStore` to map each key to a list of `[value, timestamp]` pairs.
- When inserting with `set()`, append to the list â€” the timestamps are guaranteed to be strictly increasing.
- Use **binary search** in `get()` to find the most recent value with `timestamp â‰¤ given timestamp`.

## ðŸ’» Code (Python)

```python
class TimeMap:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.keyStore = {}  # Dictionary to store key-value pairs along with timestamps

    def set(self, key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
        """
        Stores the key with the value at the given timestamp.
        """
        if key not in self.keyStore:
            self.keyStore[key] = []  # Create a new list for the key if not present
        self.keyStore[key].append([value, timestamp])

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: int) -> str:
        """
        Returns a value such that set was called previously,
        with timestamp_prev <= timestamp.
        If there are multiple such values, it returns the value
        associated with the largest timestamp_prev. If there are
        no values, it returns an empty string.
        """
        res, values = "", self.keyStore.get(key, [])  # Initialize result and get list of values for the key
        l, r = 0, len(values) - 1  # Initialize left and right pointers for binary search

        while l <= r:
            m = (l + r) // 2
            if values[m][1] <= timestamp:
                res = values[m][0]  # Update result if the timestamp is valid
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m - 1

        return res  # Return the final result

        

```

## ðŸ’¡ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(log n)
  - set() â†’ O(1), appending to a list
  - get() â†’ O(log n), binary search in the list of values for a key
- **Space**: O(n)
  - Where n is the number of set operations performed
