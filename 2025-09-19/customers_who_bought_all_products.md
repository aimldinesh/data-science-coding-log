## üìå Problem Statement
Table: **Customer**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| customer_id | int  |
| product_key | int  |

- `(customer_id, product_key)` is the **primary key**.  
- Each row shows that a customer purchased a particular product.  

Table: **Product**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| product_key | int  |

- `product_key` is the **primary key**.  
- Each row indicates an existing product.  

Write a SQL query to **find the customers who bought all the products available in the Product table**.  
Return the result table in **any order**.

## üìù Example

**Input:**

Customer table:
| customer_id | product_key |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 6           |
| 3           | 5           |
| 3           | 6           |
| 1           | 6           |

Product table:
| product_key |
|-------------|
| 5           |
| 6           |

**Output:**

| customer_id |
|-------------|
| 1           |
| 3           |

Explanation:  
- Products available = {5, 6}  
- Customer 1 bought {5, 6} ‚Üí ‚úÖ  
- Customer 2 bought {6} only ‚Üí ‚ùå  
- Customer 3 bought {5, 6} ‚Üí ‚úÖ

## üöÄ Approach
1. **Count how many products exist in total**  
   - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product`.

2. **Count distinct products bought by each customer**  
   - Use `GROUP BY customer_id` and `COUNT(DISTINCT product_key)`.

3. **Filter customers who bought all products**  
   - Compare their count with the total count of products.

## üíª SQL Query

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id
FROM Customer
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product
);
```

---

## üîé Query Explanation

- COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) ‚Üí ensures we only count unique products per customer.
- Subquery (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product) ‚Üí gets total number of available products.
- HAVING ... = ... ‚Üí filters only those customers who purchased all products.
