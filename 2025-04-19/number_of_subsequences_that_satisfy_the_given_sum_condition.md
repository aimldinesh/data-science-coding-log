## ‚úÖ Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`.
Return the number of **non-empty subsequences** such that the **sum of the minimum and maximum elements** in the subsequence is **less than or equal to target**.

As the answer may be large, return it modulo **10‚Åπ + 7**.

## üöÄ My Approach : Two Pointers + Precomputed Powers of 2
### üí° Key Insight:
- Sort the array to handle min/max efficiently.
- For each valid pair `(left, right)` where `nums[left] + nums[right] <= target`, 
  all subsequences between `left` and `right` are valid.
  - Count of such subsequences = `2^(right - left)`
- Use two pointers: 
  - Move `left` when condition is satisfied.
  - Move `right` when it's not.

## üíª Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def numSubseq(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Sort the array
        nums.sort()
        
        # Precompute powers of 2 modulo MOD
        n = len(nums)
        power = [1] * n
        for i in range(1, n):
            power[i] = (power[i - 1] * 2) % MOD
        
        # Two-pointer approach
        left, right = 0, n - 1
        count = 0
        
        while left <= right:
            # If the smallest + largest <= target, count valid subsequences
            if nums[left] + nums[right] <= target:
                count += power[right - left]
                count %= MOD
                left += 1
            else:
                # Reduce the largest element
                right -= 1
        
        return count
```

## üí° Time and Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(n log n)
   - Sorting: O(n log n)
   - Two-pointer traversal: O(n)
- **Space**: O(n)
   - For the precomputed power array
