## âœ… Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations of the `i-th` paper, return the **h-index** of the researcher.

The **h-index** is the maximum value such that the researcher has published at least `h` papers with `h` or more citations.


---

## ðŸš€ My Approach : Binary Search
### ðŸ’¡ Key Insight:
- The **h-index** is the largest integer `h` such that there are at least `h` papers with at least `h` citations.
- The array is sorted in ascending order of citations.
- We can use **binary search** to efficiently find the **h-index** by looking for the point where the number of citations is greater than or equal to `n - mid`, where `mid` is the middle index of the array.

## ðŸ’» Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(citations)  # Total number of papers
        left, right = 0, n - 1

        # Binary search to find the h-index
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if citations[mid] < n - mid:
                left = mid + 1  # Move to the right half
            else:
                right = mid - 1  # Move to the left half

        # The h-index is calculated as n - left
        return n - left
```

## ðŸ’¡ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(log n), for binary search.
- **Space**: O(1), (constant space
