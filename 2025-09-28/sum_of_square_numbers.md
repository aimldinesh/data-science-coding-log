## âœ… Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `c`, determine if there exist two integers `a` and `b` such that:  

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c
\]

## ðŸ”¹ Examples

**Example 1:**  
Input: `c = 5`  
Output: `true`  
Explanation: 1Â² + 2Â² = 5  

**Example 2:**  
Input: `c = 3`  
Output: `false`  
Explanation: No integers `a` and `b` exist such that aÂ² + bÂ² = 3.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Approach

We use the **two-pointer technique**:

1. Initialize `left = 0` and `right = int(sqrt(c))`.  
   - Because `a` and `b` cannot be larger than `sqrt(c)`.  
2. Compute `total = leftÂ² + rightÂ²`.  
   - If `total == c` â†’ return `True`.  
   - If `total > c` â†’ decrease `right` (to reduce sum).  
   - If `total < c` â†’ increase `left` (to increase sum).  
3. Repeat until `left > right`.  
4. If no match found â†’ return `False`.

## ðŸ”¹ Code (Python)

```python
from math import sqrt

class Solution:
    def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
        # Two-pointer approach
        left, right = 0, int(sqrt(c))

        while left <= right:
            total = left * left + right * right

            if total > c:
                # Too large, decrease right
                right -= 1
            elif total < c:
                # Too small, increase left
                left += 1
            else:
                # Found: left^2 + right^2 == c
                return True

        # No such pair found
        return False
```

## ðŸ’¡ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time**: 
    - At most, left and right move across 0 â†’ sqrt(c).
    - Complexity = O(âˆšc).
- **Space**: O(1)
    - Only constant extra space is used.
