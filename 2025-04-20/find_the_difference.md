## âœ… Problem Statement
- Given two strings `s` and `t`, where `t` is generated by shuffling `s` and adding one extra character at a random position, return the **extra character** that was added in `t`.
---

## ðŸš€ My Approach 1 : Frequency Counting using Dictionary
### ðŸ’¡ Key Insight:
- Count the frequency of characters in string `s`.
- Then iterate over string `t` and decrease the count.
- The character whose count goes below 0 or is not present in `s` is the added character.

## ðŸ’» Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        # Count frequencies of characters in s
        count_s = {}
        for char in s:
            count_s[char] = count_s.get(char, 0) + 1

        # Check each character in t
        for char in t:
            if char not in count_s or count_s[char] == 0:
                return char  # Extra character
            count_s[char] -= 1

```

## ðŸ’¡ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(n + m), where n = len(s) and m = len(t), usually m = n + 1
- **Space**: O(1), constant space, since the alphabet size is fixed (only lowercase letters)

---
## ðŸš€ My Approach 2 : Efficient Approach: XOR Trick
### ðŸ’¡ Key Insight:
- XORing the same characters cancels them out (`a ^ a = 0`).
- Only the extra character remains after XORing all characters in `s + t`.

## ðŸ’» Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        result = 0  # Initialize XOR result

        # XOR all characters in both strings
        for char in s + t:
            result ^= ord(char)

        return chr(result)  # Convert the final result to a character

```

## ðŸ’¡ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(n + m), where n = len(s) and m = len(t)
- **Space**: O(1),  uses only a few variables
